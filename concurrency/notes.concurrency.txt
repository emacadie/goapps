Concurrency in go

They did not talk too much about immutability

concurrency vs parallelism

single task
concurency: having multiple tasks
parallelism: execute multiple tasks simyltaneously

shopping:
single task: you need to buy one item
concurency: you need to buy multiple items (order may be random)
parallelism: multiple people shopping for multiple items at the same time (perhaps each has part of the list)
