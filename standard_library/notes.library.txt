why use standard library?
prewritten and tested
it will be tested since it's part of Go
will probably not be abandoned



https://golang.org/pkg/

Files we make:
showmestuff.go
dosomething.go
dinnertotal.go
flagtest.go
scandemo.go
bufiodemo.go
filemaker.go

scandemo2.go
sscanfdemo.go
scanlndemo.go
printdemo.go
printfdemo.go


https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/
fmt:
Println adds a return at the end
Print does not

This guy jumps around, reuses blows away what's in his file and does something different, pastes text without warning.
I don't like this guy at all.

Now to module 3
fmt package
formats input and output

Sscanf: handles input, like printf handles output
scanln: scans a line

printf format specifiers
%v - default
%s - string
%d - decimal integers
%g - floating point
%b - base 2 numbers
%o - base 8 numbers
%t - true or false
(This guy had "base 22" and "base 88". I am starting to lose confidence. Maybe they shouldn't let .NET people talk about Go.)
And he is blowing away the contents of a file AGAIN.
Sprintf can be used to put formatted output into a variable (such as for a file or web app)
