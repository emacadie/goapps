why use standard library?
prewritten and tested
it will be tested since it's part of Go
will probably not be abandoned



https://golang.org/pkg/

Files we make:
showmestuff.go
dosomething.go
dinnertotal.go
flagtest.go
scandemo.go
bufiodemo.go
filemaker.go

https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/
fmt:
Println adds a return at the end
Print does not

This guy jumps around, reuses blows away what's in his file and does something different, pastes text without warning.
I don't like this guy at all.

Now to module 3
